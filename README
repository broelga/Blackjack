v0.17.2
Improved and optimized menu. 
Splitting is working consistently.
When hand is split player will first be prompted to choose play for hand #1 and then hand #2.
Issues:
Both hand #1 and hand #2 are changed each round by stand, hit or doubleDown no matter which hand is shown.
This will be managed by reconfiguring functions and posssible menuing in order to control each hand respectively.

v0.17.1
Additional functionality - splitHand is now working. 
Some functionality needs to be implemented such as the ability to control each hand separately. 
This is next on the list.

* Enable bools for turn on certain options for testing the game, ex: canSplit = true, allows for you to split the deck.
